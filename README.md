# CardMaster

## Introduction

CardMaster is a simple yet powerful web application designed to facilitate the sharing of bank account details in a secure and visually appealing way. In regions like Sudan, where transferring bank details via unsafe platforms is common, CardMaster aims to minimize risks and streamline the process by allowing users to create and download a bank card image that includes essential information such as their full name, account number, and bank branch.
